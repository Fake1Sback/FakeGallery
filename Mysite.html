            <h2>Pixel Art</h2>
            <p>Pixel art is a form of digital art, created through the use of software, where images are edited on the pixel level. The aesthetic for this kind of graphics comes from 8-bit and 16-bit computers and video game consoles. In most pixel art, the color palette used is extremely limited in size, with some pixel art using only two colors.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The term pixel art was first published by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982. The concept, however, goes back about 11 years before that, for example in Richard Shoup's SuperPaint system in 1972, also at Xerox PARC.</p>

            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Although the definition of the medium is not concrete, the majority of pixel artists agree that an image can be categorized as pixel art when the artist is manipulating the image with deliberate control over the placement of each individual pixel.</p>
